=head1 NAME

CAD::Drawing::IO::Compressed - load and save compressed data

=head1 NOTICE

This works well for single-file formats like dxf and dwg, but currently
has no support for directory formats (which would need to be saved in
'tarball' form.)

=head1 Requisite Plug-in Functions

See CAD::Drawing::IO for a description of the plug-in architecture.

=cut
########################################################################
# the following are required to be a disc I/O plugin:
our $can_save_type = "compressed";
our $can_load_type = $can_save_type;
our $is_inherited = 0;

=head2 check_type

Returns true if $type is "compressed" or $filename has a ".gz" extension
(probably the best way.)

  $fact = check_type($filename, $type);

=cut
sub check_type {
	my ($filename, $type) = @_;
	my $extension;
	if($filename =~ m/.*\.(\w+)$/) {
		$extension = $1;
	}
	$extension = lc($extension);
	if(defined($type)) {
#        print "type was defined\n";
		($type eq "compressed") && return("compressed");
		return();
	}
	elsif($extension eq "gz") {
		return("compressed");
	}
	return();
} # end subroutine check_type definition

=head1 Compressed I/O functions

These use File::Temp and compression modules to create a compressed
version of most supported I/O types (FIXME: need a tar scheme for
directory-based formats (currently unsupported))
